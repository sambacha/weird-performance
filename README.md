## Disable double tap to zoom to improve FID

For background see [Issue 1108987: Disable double tap to zoom when width=devicewidth or initial_scale=1?](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id%3D1108987&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNEbEVB7yYOkxIKuB9z6v9m2Vpf0SA)

### First Input Delay Changes in Chrome 91

Disable double-tap-to-zoom on mobile viewports
Double-tap-to-zoom (DTZ) is a gesture used to zoom into text. Previously, DTZ was disabled when either zooming was disabled (min-zoom equal to max-zoom) or when the content width fits the viewport width. After this change, we also disable DTZ when the viewport meta tag specifies width=device-width or initial-scale>=1.0, even when implicitly doing so, like for example in minimum-scale=1.5, maximum-scale=2.

Because DTZ negatively impacts FID and the amount of pages where DTZ is disabled is increased, we expect some sites to see better FID scores.

> When were users affected?
> Chrome 91 is currently scheduled to be released the week of July 20, 2021.

To remove the 300-350ms tap delay, all you need is the following in the <head> of your page:

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
```
This sets the viewport width to the same as the device, and is generally a best-practice for mobile-optimized sites. With this tag, browsers assume you've made text readable on mobile, and the double-tap-to-zoom feature is dropped in favour of faster clicks.

If for some reason you cannot make this change, you can use touch-action: manipulation to achieve the same effect either across the page or on particular elements:
 
```css
html {
    touch-action: manipulation;
}
```

 
## Style calculation takes much longer for multiple `<style>`s vs one big `<style>`
 
> [https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1337599&q=component%3ABlink%3ECSS](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1337599&q=component%3ABlink%3ECSS)
 
Chrome seems to take much longer to calculate style for a DOM with multiple `<style>`s in the `<head>` than when those same stylesheets are concatenated into one big `<style>`.

For Firefox and Safari, there is no equivalent performance cliff. These browsers show essentially no difference between multiple `<style>`s versus one big `<style>`.

Here are the numbers for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, all taken on the same machine (2021 Mac Book Pro), taking the median of 5 runs (milliseconds):

| Browser     | One big style | Multiple styles |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Chrome 102  | 28            | 1354            |
| Firefox 98  | 38            | 30              |
| Safari 15.5 | 827           | 855             |


 #### Solution
 
The best practice from Chromium's POV would be to concatenate stylesheets wherever possible, but to avoid doing so if any of those stylesheets will be individually modified in the future (or if route-splitting makes it more advantageous to cache them separately).
